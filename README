##       OVH Config Script v. 0.12.brandynew       ##
##                                                 ##
##                                                 ##
## Usage:  This script is meant to be run when you ##
##         log into a new system for the first     ##
##         time.   From then on, it can be re-run  ##
##         periodically to make sure that the      ##
##         system is secure.                       ##
##                                                 ##
## Notice: This script is still in the very early  ##
##         stages.  It's also the first bash       ##
##         script that I have ever written.  So    ##
##         if you see aything or have any tips,    ##
##         please let meknow.  Any feedback would  ##
##         really be really be appreciated.        ##
##                                                 ##
## .:Please don't share this script w/o approval:. ##
##                                                 ##
## Other Notes:                                    ##
##                                                 ##
##         This script has only been tested on OVH ##
##         running Arch. It uses programs and file ##
##         locations that should be included by    ##
##         default on most major distros, and it   ##
##         is intended to work on most distros out ##
##         of the box.  The aim is to have it be   ##
##         able to run this no matter what is      ##
##         being used.  So if you notice something ##
##         that is not working properly, please    ##
##         take down the distro you are using, and ##
##         and let me know what the error was.     ##
